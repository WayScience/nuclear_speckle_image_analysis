# Illumination correction (IC)

In this module, we perform illumination correction on the maximum projected images to remove uneven illumination and vignetting.
It takes approximately one hour to process all plates with IC.

## Perform IC

To perform IC on all plates in parallel, run the command below:

```bash
# Make sure you are in the 2.illumination_correction folder in terminal
source illumination_correction.sh
```
