# Nuclear Speckle Image Analysis

In this repository, image analysis and image-based profiling is performed on a nuclear speckle dataset to extract intensity based features to predict nuclear speckle protein markers.

We have 3 channels in this assay:

**DAPI** - nucleus stain
**A647** - SON protein marker for nuclear speckles
**GOLD** - SRRM2 protein marker for nuclear speckles
